# DIY earthquake detector 
This project demonstrate the use of arduino uno controler with vibration sensor to detect an earthquake and give alert using a buzzer and LED.

# Components
- Arduino uno
- SW-420 vibration sensor
- LEDs
- Resistors

# Tools
-**Simulation:** Proteus 8

-**Design:** Breadboard, Jumper wires

-**Arduino program:** C++

# How it works
- The arduino controller take an input from the vibration sensor and control the LEDs and buzzer to signal alert.
